At the end of HT3, Y11 students completed their second controlled assessment in Computer Science. I can now report on Raphael's final marks (subject to moderation): 60/63 for the traditional scenario and 63/63 for the mobile scenario. This means in the COMP2 exam Raphael should be aiming for an approximate minimum of 57/84 marks needed to secure grade A*. Given Raphael's passion for my subject I am not concerned this will be a challenge for him.

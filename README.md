Ideas for new KS3 teaching resources on 'security'

## fake_ransomware.py
Students get a new sandbox account and explore the 'mystery' files contained on the user's drive. They are then told to download and complete a quiz about file names, types etc - but this is instead a Python script that encrypts the files they have been looking at (WannaCry style).

## fake_ddos.py
Discussion around how sending repeated GET request to a server does not constitute a successful DOS attack.
